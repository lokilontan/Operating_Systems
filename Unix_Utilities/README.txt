## wcat

The program **wcat** is a simple program. Generally, it reads a file as
specified by the user and prints its contents. A typical usage is as follows,
in which the user wants to see the contents of main.cpp, and thus types: 

```
prompt> ./wcat main.cpp
#include <stdio.h>
...
```

## wgrep

The second utility you will build is called **wgrep**, a variant of the UNIX
tool **grep**. This tool looks through a file, line by line, trying to find a
user-specified search term in the line. If a line has the word within it, the
line is printed out, otherwise it is not. 

Here is how a user would look for the term **foo** in the file **bar.txt**:

```
prompt> ./wgrep foo bar.txt
this line has foo in it
so does this foolish line; do you see where?
even this line, which has barfood in it, will be printed.
```

## wzip and wunzip

The next tools you will build come in a pair, because one (**wzip**) is a
file compression tool, and the other (**wunzip**) is a file decompression
tool. 

The type of compression used here is a simple form of compression called
*run-length encoding* (*RLE*). RLE is quite simple: when you encounter **n**
characters of the same type in a row, the compression tool (**wzip**) will
turn that into the number **n** and a single instance of the character.

Thus, if we had a file with the following contents:
```
aaaaaaaaaabbbb
```
the tool would turn it (logically) into:
```
10a4b
```

However, the exact format of the compressed file is quite important; here,
you will write out a 4-byte integer in binary format followed by the single
character in ASCII. Thus, a compressed file will consist of some number of
5-byte entries, each of which is comprised of a 4-byte integer (the run
length) and the single character.
